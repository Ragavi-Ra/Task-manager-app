# Task Manager App

## Home page
- In Home page, I used the given mock task REST API and listed the tasks along with the status in simple styling
- I used axios, bottom tab navigation, loading spinners and proper error handling during API fetches

## Adding Tasks page
- In AddTask page I used a text input to get the task and listed them using Flatlist with simple styling
- On clicking the each of the list, the page will be directed to TaskDetails page, I used stack navigation here
- To store the tasks I used local storage using AsyncStorage

## Task Details page
- We can mofify the status of tasks here and on clicking status button, it redirects to AddTask page and change that status in the listing
